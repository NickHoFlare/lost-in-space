# Day 2
## Overview
Using a breadboard to prototype a circuit, create a circuit from one of the IO pins, routing through an external LED, then completing the circuit by finishing at `GND` (Ground).

Essentially same thing as Day 1, but involving an external LED this time, with some additional wiring to hook it up in the circuit and allow it to be fed with power and enables programmability.

## Electronics
LEDs have two electrodes - short and long. They only work when current flows in one direction: `long -> short`. i.e. Long prong connected to higher voltage, short prong connected to lower voltage.

Resistors - The resistance of a resistor can be determined by looking at the bands of colour on the resistor. A resistor should be held with the grouped bands on the left, and the solitary band on the right. Resistors should be read from left to right.

e.g. Brown - Black - Black - Brown == 1 - 0 - 0 - *10 == 100 * 10 == 1000 Ohms
